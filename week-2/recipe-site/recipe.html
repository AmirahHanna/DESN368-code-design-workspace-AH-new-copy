<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
  <li>2 large eggs</li>
  <li>Salt, to taste</li>
  <li>Black pepper, to taste</li>
  <li>1/2 tablespoon olive oil, butter, or bacon grease</li>
</ul>
<h2>Instructions</h2>
<ol>
  <li> In a small bowl, whisk the eggs, salt, and pepper together until lightly frothy.</li>
  <li>In an 8-inch non-stick pan, heat the oil over <strong>medium-low</strong> heat. Pour in the eggs and tilt the pan to make sure they're evenly spread out, then turn the heat down to <strong>low</strong>. <br>Cook the omelette for 2 to 3 minutes, or until the edges are cooked through and the top is <em>slightly</em> wet but not runny.</li>
  <li>If you'd like to add filling, add it to half of the omelette. Then use a spatula to <strong>fold the empty half on top</strong> and slide the omelette onto a plate. Garnish with chopped herbs.</li>
</ol>
